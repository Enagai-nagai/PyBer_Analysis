# PyBer_Analysis
Data Analysis for PyBer (Python-based ride share servive)

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

## Overview:
PyBer is a ride sharing company operating in the United States. 
This analysis is done to demonstrate the different or similar trend among different types of places where PyBer is operating and to have insights for a better decision making for the future strategy.

### Note
The places where PyBer is operating can be categoralized in 3 types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural depending on its population and density.

## Results:

### Overall Data of Fares by each city type

Findings  
* Urban areas have the most rides and drivers, followed by Suburban, and then Rural.
* The average fare per ride in Rural areas is higher than that in Suburban or Urban areas probably because the trip length is longer and the trip distance is larger because places in rural areas are dispersed.
* The average fare per driver in Rural areas is higher than that in Suburban or Urban areas most likely because there are less drivers, which causes less supply and increase of fare.


### Total Fares by each city type

Findings  
* Regardless of the time of year, the Urban area always has the largest total fares (about twice as much as the Suburban area), followed by the Suburban and Rural areas.
* The weekly total fares increased by about 400 USD from the week of Feb 15 to from the week of Feb 22. The reason is unknown.
* The suburban weekly total fares showed its increasing trend from the week of April 15th to the end of April while other two city types showed otherwise.

## Summary
### Recommendation:
* PyBer should strengthen its strategy in suburban areas as it is the only area that shows its increasing trend in the total fare.
* Pyber should consider withdrawing its operation from rural areas. This is because fare revenues are quite low compared to other areas. Also it is not realistic to keep providing a stable service with such a small number of drivers.
